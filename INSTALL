# If you don't know how to get to a terminal on Retropie, you can plug in a keyboard and press 'F4' when you get to the game select screen (this menu is called emulationstation).
# From there, you can type the line in. If you want to copy and paste, I recommend setting up ssh. Read about that here: 'https://retropie.org.uk/docs/SSH/'

# Here is how you install (copy the following line in a terminal on the pi):
git clone https://github.com/brandflake11/Retropie-Airplane-Mode.git ~/RetroPie/retropiemenu/wireless

# And then you're all done. You should only run the above line once.
#
# When you're ready to update (if the scripts get any updates), run the following line (in a terminal on the pi, of course):
git -C ~/RetroPie/retropiemenu/wireless pull

# The above line runs a 'git pull' in the folder specified above. You can run it in any directory and still update the wireless directory, unlike 'git pull'. 
#
# And you should then get the latest changes, assuming you didn't make any changes to the scripts. 

# If you followed the original instructions and installed your scripts under ~/RetroPie/roms/ports/wireless (a wireless folder under the ports menu of EmulationStation, the RetroPie menu), then run the following line once:
mv ~/RetroPie/roms/ports/wireless ~/RetroPie/retropiemenu/wireless && git -C ~/RetroPie/retropiemenu/wireless pull

# The above line will move the wireless folder and update it for you.
# If you aren't sure what this last point is talking about and you haven't installed these scripts yet, don't worry about this last line.
