* Todo

Note: Change branch when doing this to not disturb other users

I need to update the README.MD to reflect:
- The other contributor for anything he/she submits
- What the scripts do for the piboy dmg
  - How it manages the osd for the piboy as well.
  - Note it is only for 1.03 of the firmware
  - Note how it changes files in a hacky way in order to accomplish its goals

I need to update the INSTALL to just point to the update-airplane-mode.sh script

* Installation/Update Script

This script should be made as follows:
- Look to see if the Airplane mode folder exists
  - If it doesn't, then do the git clone to install the folder
  - If it does, then skip the function to install the Airplane mode
- Detect if the user is on a piboy. Look at /proc OR use ps aux and find if the osd program is running. Here is how you find the osd running without finding grep:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
ps aux | grep "/home/pi/osd/[o]sd"
#+END_SRC
  - Ask if the user wants the scripts to alter the osd
    - Register a variable if yes/no (1/0)
- Finally, put the update/install (just call it an update script to not confuse users) as a release. The release can be the same script but named as install.

* Change the icons for the Bluetooth icon

1. Don't do any of this if the user chose not to alter the osd. Skip these functions, so need a check at the beginning
2. Needs to enable the bluetooth icon for any of this to work. 
3. We need to rename the experimentalpi movie to do this
4. Here is a table of how this will work: 
     # I need to look back at this table, as it isn't 100% right
     | Script Name              | What osd icon changes                                                 |   |   |   |
     |--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+---+---+---|
     | disable-airplane-mode.sh | Enable wifi osd, then change bluetooth icon to on                     |   |   |   |
     | enable-airplane-mode.sh  | Disable wifi and bluetooth osd, and change bluetooth icon to airplane |   |   |   |
     | disable-networking.sh    | Enable wifi osd, Change wifi icon to normal                           |   |   |   |
     | enable-networking.sh     | Enable wifi osd, Change the wifi icon to normal                       |   |   |   |
     | disable-bluetooth.sh     | Change bluetooth icon to off                                          |   |   |   |
     | enable-bluetooth.sh      | Change bluetooth icon to on                                           |   |   |   |
     |                          |                                                                       |   |   |   |
5. Restart the osd script
6. Name the experimentalpi video back

Put in readme.md that this part of the script assumes that the piboy is setup normally as it needs root permissions. If the piboy is using a normal retropie setup without the sudo security, then it should be all good.

* Change the startup time in the systemd wifi service

I'm not sure if I want to reach too far into this one, but maybe it won't hurt anything to decrease the timeout. I hope I don't break anything.

It needs testing.
