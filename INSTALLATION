# Here is how you install (copy the following line in a terminal on the pi):
git clone https://github.com/brandflake11/Retropie-Airplane-Mode.git ~/RetroPie/roms/ports/wireless

# And then you're all done.
#
# When you're ready to update, run the following line (in a terminal on the pi, of course):
git -C ~/RetroPie/roms/ports/wireless pull

# The above line runs a 'git pull' in the folder specified above. You can run it in any directory and still update the wireless directory, unlike 'git pull'. 
#
# And you should then get the latest changes, assuming you didn't make any changes to the scripts.
