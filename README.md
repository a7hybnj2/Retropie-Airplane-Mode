# Retropie-Airplane-Mode
A collection of scripts to allow for disabling and enabling wireless capabilities for Linux, specifically for Retropie and the Raspberry Pi.

# Goal
These scripts should be targeted specifically for the Raspberry Pi. Personally, I am using them on the Piboy DMG, but they should work for any RPI-based handheld.

# What these scripts don't do
The scripts definitely won't disable wired connection. These scripts only disable wireless communications.

# Instructions
Copy this whole folder to ~/Retropie/roms/ports to have a quick an easy method to turn off/on wireless without interfering with your list of ports games.

For easy installation instructions, look at the file INSTRUCTIONS in this directory.
